# UFOs
Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world.

# Project Summary
My custom webpage displays UFO sightings that have been reported around the world. A person can search for UFO sighting(s) by filtering on date, city, state, country, and shape. The table displays results according to user input (changes in the filters). For example, if I were to filter by a date as 1/10/2010, my table shows 11 results. If I wanted to filter by a date of 1/10/210 and by a state of "ca" (California), my table would then show 2 results. Clicking on "UFO sightings" at the top left corner will reset my table by clearing out all my filters.

# Technologies

* JavaScript

# Recommendations
Some recommendations for further development include:
* Creating and placing a "Clear" button in the "Filter Search" form as opposed to using the "UFO sightings".
* Adding a drop-down menu in each filter to allow the user to select a choice within the menu.
